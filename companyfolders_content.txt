First and foremost, every single presentation folder should do 3 things at it's most basic nature. The three things that presentations folders should always do are:

<ul>
<li>Defining who you are (or who the company is).</li>
<li>They should entice the audience to look inside.</li>
<li>They should direct an audience to contact information.</li>
</ul>

Fonts & Layout

Obviously, you will want to make your presentation folder as unique as possible while at the same time still looking professional. Here are some tips that will help expidite that process.

<ul>
<li>Avoid using text or logos on the left third of the front cover. This is the side of the presentation folder that gets "flipped" the fastest.</li>
<li>For you headline text, use sans-serif fonts and for you body text use serif fonts.</li>
<li>When it comes to surrounding your logo, you need to use at least 1/4" of empty space.</li>

Tips Considering the Paper

Consider the paper you are using when making presentation folders. When it comes to choosing paper for your presentation folders, there are about 5 things you always want to keep in mind:

Paper Weight - You don't want to make the paper too heavy (overkill) and you don't want it too light (flimsy). Choose at least a 12pt or 80lbs, although some think even 12pt

How Many Folders Do You Need? - When yuo are ordering presentation folders in bulk, you can get them for a lot cheaper.

C1S's & C2S's - This refers to c oating applied at the paper mill before your printer gets the paper and prints on it. They respectively stand for "coated one side" and "coated two sides." Coatin is used to make the printing surfaces smooth and it also acts as a barrier to help keep the ink on the surface of a printed sheet.

Picking an FSC or SFI-Certified paper - These are industries that ensure that your paper stock comes from sustainably harvested forests.

Your Folder Represents Your Company - Remember that every single folder should define who you are, entice the audience to look inside, and direct an audience to contact information.
